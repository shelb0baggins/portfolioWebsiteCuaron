I cannot seem to get the animation to cover entire view. I thought that classifying all widths and heights to 100% and setting a var in js to read the window's height and width would do it, but sadly it has not. Anyone able to lend a hand? I'm sure the issue is easily solvable, but I cannot seem to crack it (first time using paper.js tbh)

Thanks ya'll!
